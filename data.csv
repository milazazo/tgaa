Since they're such an iconic 2/3 of a trio‚ I thought drawing them in a matching pose was a must. Shu came up with the idea of using Mario and Luigi as pose references since the Skulkin's design is reminiscent of them. So‚ if you match the brothers up right next to each other‚ they're doing a together‚ brother pose!"
